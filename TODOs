Fix progress bar issue (PerformedList) - ProgressView initialized with an out-of-bounds progress value. The value will be clamped to the range of `0...total`. (line 224)


Error in EditServicePerformedInfo - displayModeButtonItem is internally managed and not exposed for DoubleColumn style. Returning an empty, disconnected UIBarButtonItem to fulfill the non-null contract.
    .navigationViewStyle(StackNavigationViewStyle()) doesnt seem to fix it as some posts say (line 121)
